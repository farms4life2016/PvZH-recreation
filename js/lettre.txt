Dear Ms. Schwartz,

As my grade 12 journey comes to a close, I would like to thank you greatly for what you’ve done to help me reach where I am today. Unfortunately, we didn’t meet for the majority of TOK, but I could tell that you were working behind ManageBac on our CAS activities and the TOK essay. I also appreciate how you managed gardening club. Sadly, we don't have enough time this year to plant the tree, so maybe the new tree will be up the next time I come visit.

I am pleased to announce that I will be studying at the Univerty of Waterloo in the fall.


I've noticed that you don't like to speak very loudly. 

I sometimes found it difficult to make out what you say, partially due to my (former) hearing problems, and I always found it shocking when you respond to something I whisper at the back of the class. Anyways, 

I would like to formally apologize for wasting chemicals during the IA. I got a little carried away with testing out an idea was never tested before and potentially making a great discovery - which ultimately didn't work out. I'm hoping that the leftovers from my failed experiment were reused or disposed of properly; perhaps the acetic acid can be used elsewhere, maybe in a lab to make esters? I heard someone say that you can turn someone's alcoholic drink into a fruit-smelling non-alcoholic drink by adding vinegar or lemon juice - could I possibly do that to avoid alcohol in university?



Dear Ms. Xie,

I'm trying to learn some Javascript (Js) over the summer. I often find myself just translating Java code from my head into Js on the computer, but it doesn't always work - partially because the syntax is slightly different. Apparently Js does not really have OOP.
